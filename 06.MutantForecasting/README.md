# Mutant analysis in response to reviewer comments

To test our machine-learned model, we will examine mutant embryos in the following folders

- Public/Halo_twist[ey53]
- Public/toll[rm9]
- Public/spaetzle[A]

In **VisualizeMutantData.ipynb**, we will plot the mutant datasets, examine time-alignment for embryos like twist that show development of a DV gradient.

In **FlowPredictor.ipynb**, we will demonstrate the ability to predict flow from mutant myosin fields using a deep neural network 

In **ForecastCoupledDynamics.ipynb**, we will demonstrate the SINDy model applied to each mutant and verify its predictive power
