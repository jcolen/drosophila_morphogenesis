# Minimal models analysis

This folder contains Python files and associated Jupyter notebooks for running simulations of minimal models inspired by the SINDy analysis. We use the [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/) library to run these simulations, which has some compatibility issues with the PyTorch environment used elsewhere in this repo. So unless otherwise noted, the scripts here should be run using an environment which has Dedalus [installed](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html).

There is also a plotting notebook FigurePlotting.ipynb which uses the standard environment used in all other files in this repo.
